## Do not go gentle into that crash bug
### by Joe Winter
#### Adapted from *Do not go gentle into that good night* by Dylan Thomas

```
Do not go gentle into that crash bug,
Old code should burn and rave at refactoring;
Rage, rage against the crashing of the app.

Though senior developers at their cubicles know TDD is right,
Because their methods had worked in staging they
Do not go gentle into that crash bug.

Good juniors, the last they try, crying how might
Their frail code might have taken down the whole server,
Rage, rage against the crashing of the app.

Wild designers who caught and questioned an end user in flight,
And learn, too late, the prototype wasn't ready for the day,
Do not go gentle into that crash bug.

C coders, near death, who swap memory in their sight
Windows virtual memory could leak like fire hydrants and be okay,
Range, rage against the crashing of the app.
